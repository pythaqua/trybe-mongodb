# trybe-mongodb

Here you'll find projects I've developed during the *Back-End* module of [Trybe's Fullstack Web Development course](#about-trybes-fullstack-web-development-course).  

Each one of them was conceived by Trybe as an assessment of the learning obtained from its respective content block by its students. They had to code solutions that met predefined requirements and whose results passed automated tests cases (unit or integration). In the case of the ones listed below, we had to write MongoDB scripts with queries that matched the expected results defined in each requirement of the project description.

Any comment, criticizing or observation is welcome.
